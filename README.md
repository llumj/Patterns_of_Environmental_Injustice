Title: Exploring historical redlining in Los Angeles and its legacy on present-day environmental justice

About-
Redlining is a loaning practice from the 1930’s Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), brought on as a part of the New Deal. This repository aims to analyze the impact of redlining on observations of biodiversity, specifically birds.

Data-
Data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool. EJScreen provides environmental and demographic information for the US at the Census tract and block group levels, it has been downloaded from the EPA website.

A team of researchers, led by the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond have digitized maps and information from the HOLC as part of the Mapping Inequality project.

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility is the largest aggregator of biodiversity observations in the world. Observations typically include a location and date that a species was observed. Data is from 2021 onward
