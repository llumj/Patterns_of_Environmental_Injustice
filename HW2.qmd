## Part 1: Legacy of redlining in current environmental (in)justice

#### Load Packages and Read Data

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
library(stars)
library(kableExtra)
library(here)
library(dplyr)

library(patchwork)
library(knitr)
```

#### Read in data
```{r}
# Read in data with here
la_red <- st_read(here::here("data", "mapping-inequality", "mapping-inequality-los-angeles.json"), quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  st_make_valid()

# Read in bird biodiversity data
birds <- st_read(here::here("data", "gbif-birds-LA", "gbif-birds-LA.shp"), quiet = TRUE)

# Read in ejscreen data
ejscreen <- st_read(here::here("data", "ejscreen", "EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb"), quiet = TRUE)

```

#### Check the coordinate system 
```{r}
#| warning: true
# Create a vector with the CRSs
crs_vector <- c(st_crs(ejscreen), st_crs(la_red), st_crs(birds))

# Check if all CRSs are equal to each other
if (length(unique(crs_vector)) > 1) {
  warning("Warning: Not all CRSs are equal! Consider transforming the data")
} else {
  print("All good: All CRSs match")
}
```

#### Transform coordinate system for ejscreen to match la_red
```{r}
# Transform la_red to match ejscreen coordinate system 
ejscreen <- st_transform(ejscreen, crs = st_crs(la_red))
```

#### Check the coordinate system again 
```{r}
#| warning: true

# Check if all CRSs are equal to each other
if (length(unique(crs_vector)) > 1) {
  warning("Warning: Not all CRSs are equal! Consider transforming the data")
} else {
  print("All good: All CRSs match")
}
```

#### Filter ejscreen data counties that make our base map
```{r}
# Use filter to filter data for LA, Orange, and San Bernardino Counties 
los_ang_county <- ejscreen %>%
filter(CNTY_NAME == "Los Angeles County")

orange_county <- ejscreen %>% 
  filter(CNTY_NAME == "Orange County")

san_bern_county <- ejscreen %>% 
  filter(CNTY_NAME == "San Bernardino County")
```

#### Make a map of neighborhoods colored by HOLC grades
```{r}
# Use tmap package to make holc map
holc_map_la <- tm_shape(los_ang_county, 
                        bbox = la_red) +
  tm_polygons(border.col = "black",
              col = "seashell") +
  tm_shape(la_red) +

                                   "#FFA400",
                                   "#A31621"), 
              title = "HOLC Grade",
              border.alpha = .4,
              border.col = "black",
              alpha = .7) +

    legend.bg.color = NA,
    bg.color = "seashell") +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("RIGHT", "BOTTOM"), 
               text.size = 0.5
               ) +
  tm_compass(type = "8star",
             position = c("LEFT", .3),
             size = 2
             )
print(holc_map_la)

```

#### A table summarizing the percent of current census block groups within each HOLC grade (or none)

```{r}
# Join la_red and los_ang_county data wiith with st_intersects to see what percentage of current census block groups are within each HOLC grade 
la_red_ej_join <- st_join(los_ang_county, la_red, st_intersects, left = FALSE)


# Calculate the percent of census block groups within each HOLC grade
summary_holc <- la_red_ej_join %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round((count / sum(count)) * 100, 0)) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(-count)

# Create the table with kableExtra
  knitr::kable(summary_holc,
        col.names = c("HOLC Grade", "% of Current Census Block"),
        format = "markdown",
        caption = "Percentage of Current Census Block Groups Within HOLC Grade") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,
                  position = "center")
     

```

#### A set of figures summarizing current conditions (from the EJScreen data) within HOLC grades using the mean of the following variables:% 
- low income
- percentile for Particulate Matter 2.5
- percentile for low life expectancy

#### Join data. Filter data for making a table and graph
```{r}
# Spatial join data 
joined_data <- st_join(los_ang_county, la_red, join = st_within)

# Filter, Select and summarize columns for mean. Group by grade
holc_mean_filter <- joined_data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(grade)) %>%
  select(LOWINCPCT, 
         P_PM25, 
         LIFEEXPPCT, 
         grade) %>%
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarise(across(c(LOWINCPCT, 
                     P_PM25, 
                     LIFEEXPPCT), 
                   list(mean = ~ round(mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 2)),
                        .names = "mean_{col}")) %>%
  mutate(mean_LOWINCPCT = mean_LOWINCPCT * 100) %>%
  mutate(mean_LIFEEXPPCT = mean_LIFEEXPPCT * 100) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()
```

#### Make data long and plot it with geom_bar
```{r}
# Gather data into long format
long_data_holc_mean <- holc_mean_filter %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(mean_LOWINCPCT, mean_P_PM25, mean_LIFEEXPPCT), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

# Create the bar graph
holc_bar_mean <- ggplot(long_data_holc_mean, 
                        aes(x = grade, 
                            y = value, 
                            fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("mean_P_PM25" = "#388697", 
               "mean_LOWINCPCT" = "#08415C", 
               "mean_LIFEEXPPCT" = "#B5FFE1"),
    labels = c("mean_P_PM25" = "Mean Percentile PM 2.5", 
               "mean_LIFEEXPPCT" = "Mean % Low Life Expectency", 
               "mean_LOWINCPCT" = "Mean % Low Income")) +
  labs(title = "Environmental and Social Conditions Across HOLC Grades", 
       x = "Grade", 
       y = "Percentage/Percentile") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Print
print(holc_bar_mean)
```

#### Create table of mean values with kable
```{r}
# First I want to round my P_PM25 column to have the same sig-figs as my other two columns 
holc_mean_filter$mean_P_PM25 <- round(holc_mean_filter$mean_P_PM25, 0)

# Create mean table with kableExtra
  kable(holc_mean_filter,
        caption = "Environmental and Social Conditions Across HOLC Grades",
        col.names = c("Grade", "Mean % Low Income", 
                      "Mean Percent PM25", 
                      "Mean Percent Low Life Expectency"),
        format = "markdown")

```

#### A paragraph reflecting on these results

The table shows each Grades A-D, a rating system ranked from best to poorest based on their perceived safety for real estate investment. The table shows a clear connection between the three means we selected. As the grade decreases from A to D, the mean percentage of low income, percentile of PM 2.5, percent of the population with a low life expectancy all go up. This shows that neighborhoods in the D sections, almost always occupied by minorities, suffered in all of these categories due to redlining. 

## Part 2: Legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations

#### Combine data from la_red and birds by geometry
```{r}
# Use st_join to combine la_red data to birds
joined_birds <- st_join(birds, la_red, join = st_within, left = TRUE)
```

#### Check first 10 rows of data with head (Hiding from HTML)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# print first 10 lines to check for grade 
head(joined_birds, 10)
```

#### Produce the following based on observations from 2022:

A figure summarizing the percent of observations within redlined neighborhoods within each HOLC grade
```{r}
# Filter data for year 2022, group by grade, exclude NA's, summarise the count of grade, mutate a new column with percent of bird observations by grade, select only the columns grade and bird grade pct for plot, drop geometry.
holc_birds <- joined_birds %>%
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  filter(grade != "NA") %>%
  summarise(count_id = n()) %>%
  mutate(bird_grade_pct = round(count_id/sum(count_id) * 100),2) %>%
  select(grade, bird_grade_pct) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()

# Use ggplot to make to plot "Percentage of Total Bird Observations Within HOLC Grades"
plot1 <- ggplot(holc_birds, aes(x = grade, y = bird_grade_pct, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("A" = "#95A472", 
                               "B" = "#005E7C", 
                               "C" = "#FFA400", 
                               "D" = "#A31621")) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Total Bird Observations Within HOLC Grades", 
       x = "HOLC Grade", 
       y = "Bird Grade Percentage",
       fill = "Grade") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),
        legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

print(plot1)
```

#### A brief paragraph explaining whether these results match the findings from Ellis-Soto et al. 2023

When you look the plot for "Percentage of Total Bird Observations Within HOLC Grades" it appears that bird observations actually increase as you move down from HOLC Grades A-D. Meaning, the riskier the real estate investment (i.e. redlined neighborhoods with high minority populations) the more birds you observe. This seems completely opposite to the findings of Ellis-Soto (shown in the image below), who showed bird density decreased from HOLC A to HOLC D, with D being the lowest density. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("kuifbw1h.png")
```

The reason for this comes down to area. If you look at the map you will see that C and D make up a larger portion of the HOLC map than grades A and B. This leads to more bird observations simply because you have more area to see more birds. You can account for this by taking the total bird count for each grade and dividing it by the total area for each grade, giving you a more accurate value.

#### Filter a new data set that includes total area and count of bird observations  for each HOLC grade 
```{r}
pct_bird_obs_area <- joined_birds %>%
  filter(year == 2022, (grade != "NA")) %>%
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_area = sum(area, na.rm = TRUE),
    grade_count = n()) %>%
  mutate(bird_count_area = grade_count/total_area) %>%
  select(grade, bird_count_area) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()
```

#### Create a new plot with filtered HOLC grade and area
```{r}
plot2 <- ggplot(pct_bird_obs_area, aes(x = grade, y = bird_count_area, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("A" = "#95A472", 
                               "B" = "#005E7C", 
                               "C" = "#FFA400", 
                               "D" = "#A31621")) +
  labs(title = "Bird Observations by Area in HOLC Grades", 
       x = "HOLC Grade", 
       y = "Birds Obsevered by Area",
       fill = "Grade") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.justification = c(1, 1),
        legend.box.just = "bottom",
        legend.box.margin = margin(t = 1, b = 0, r = 1, l = 0),
        legend.location = "panel",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

```

#### Combined the plots for comparison
```{r}
combined_plots <- patchwork::wrap_plots(plot1, plot2, ncol = 1,
                      axes = 'collect')

print(combined_plots)
```
